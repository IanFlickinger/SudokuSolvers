# Comparing Solving Algorithms

Although this directory is titled benchmarking, at this point the code only compares algorithms on identical tests. It is recommended that the Solvers::DepthFirstSolverV1 be used for benchmarking. For more information on the various algorithms, see the [solvers README](../src/solvers/README.md) file in the src/solvers directory.
